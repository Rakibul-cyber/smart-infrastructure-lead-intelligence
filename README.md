# Smart Infrastructure Lead Intelligence

A Python-based portfolio project for discovering, extracting, cleaning,
scoring, and exporting publicly available B2B and public-sector lead data.

## Overview

Sales teams working with smart infrastructure products often need to identify
municipalities, public utilities, infrastructure operators, and organisations
that may have relevant digitalisation, energy-efficiency, or modernisation needs.

Manual research is slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

This project demonstrates how Python can support that workflow by collecting
public information from websites and transforming it into structured,
reviewable lead data.

## Planned Workflow

1. Read a list of target organisations.
2. Visit official organisation websites.
3. Discover relevant pages.
4. Extract public business contact information.
5. Detect infrastructure and energy-related signals.
6. Clean and deduplicate the records.
7. Calculate a transparent lead score.
8. Export the results to Excel.
9. Demonstrate dynamic website automation with Playwright.
